You should find all the general features of a text editor from the ++Editor.
This is a QT5 project, so use QtCreator or similar to compile it.

<s>May 3rd Bug notice.</s> 

<s>Fixed issues:
Setting font to italic and underlining are a bit too powerful at this point.
These features affect all the words. This issue will be fixed in a near future.</s>

<b>Usage:</b> 

Select a text you want to modify then click your button of choice(for example, underline).

When you have clicked a button to modify text, then the selected action will become global until you select some text again and press the normalization button(or anything else). After the normalization button has been pressed(while having some text selected) then your font will revert to normal.
